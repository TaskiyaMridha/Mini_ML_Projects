# Mini_ML_Project
# Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

This project focuses on predicting whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on sonar signal data. The prediction is powered by machine learning models trained on numerical features extracted from sonar returns bounced off different surfaces.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given sonar data, the goal is to classify the object as either:
- `Rock` (typically false alarm or clutter),
- or `Mine` (a potential threat like an underwater explosive).
